# FirstAlterStore
  Template for your own AlterStore repository.

## What is this?

A template from which you could create your very own AlterStore repository.

AlterStore repositories are added through the client on your KaiOS device.


## So what will I need?

- A supported operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

- `mkalterstoredb`: `npm install mkalterstoredb --global` (root access may be required)

- A KaiOS device if you want to test your repository out.

## What should I do after getting all of that?

1. Get this repo and put it somewhere on your computer.

2. Copy your app (with manifest.webapp in the folder root) to the `apps` folder inside ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜).

3. Configure your `ALTERSTORE.json` manifest. See the wiki for more information.

4. Open a terminal

5. Change directory to ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜).

6. Run `mkalterstoredb` and wait until done.

7. Upload the folder to your hosting of choice.

8. (optional) Add your repository to your client (Options -> Repositories -> Add)
